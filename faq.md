      - question: What happens during a Mentored Sprint?
        answer: >-
          The format might vary from event to event. But as a guide we try to include the following parts:
          <br><br>
          1. Welcome and housekeeping rules (CoC, reporting CoC violations, schedule, etc.) <br>
          2. Introduction to contributing to open source - mini-workshop on how to do your first contribution to an open-source project (optional live event or watch party) <br>
          3. Mentors & project presentation - introduce mentors and the project(s) they can provide mentorship for <br>
          4. Assemble teams - folks join the project they want to contribute to <br>
          5. Sprint!!<br>
          6. Celebrate wins <br>
      - question: I have never contributed to open source, can I participate?
        answer: >- 
          You definitely can. Mentored Sprints are designed to provide support and opportunities to beginners and experienced folks alike. We cover beginners friendly workshops and provide a set of resources to get you started.
      - question: I am not a developer/software engineer/coder can I participate?
        answer: >- 
          Absolutely! We want to dismantle the idea that only code contributions matter. We make sure folks with diverse backgrounds have success opportunities at each sprint. If you are a writer, designer, project manager, lawyer or whatever your current career is you are welcome and we will make sure this is a meaningful experience for you.
      - question: Can I partner with you to run a Mentored Sprint for my community/event/project?
        answer: >- 
          We are always happy to partner with folks interested in running Mentored Sprints. However, we are a small bunch of very busy folks so it is not always possible. Please reach out using our contact form here and we can discuss this further. 
      - question: Can I use your Code of Conduct?
        answer: >- 
          Yes, you can use the Code of Conduct from Mentored Sprints. You can find this in the Comunity handbook. It is released under a CC-BY license so you will need to keep the attribution section and attribute our source.
          Also, remember a CoC of conduct on its own is not enough. It needs to be enforced.
      - question: Can this event be run online?
        answer: >-
          Definitely! Due to the many challenges introduced by the 2020 Covid-19 situation we had to pivot to online sprints. Make sure to check the Community handbook to learn how to best organise this kind of sprints.
      - question: I would like to organise an event for my company/community/project how can I do it?
        answer: >-
          Make sure to check the [Organisers]({% link getstarted.md %}) section in this website. There you will find a useful guide to get you through the organisation phase, as well as our brand guidelines and guidelines to add your event to our website for outreach.
      - question: How can I keep up to date with the upcoming events and developments?
        answer: >- 
           You can check our website regularly or you can join our Newsletter. 
      - question: How can I be involved in Mentored Sprints?
        answer: >-
